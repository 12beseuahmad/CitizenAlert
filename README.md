# CitizenAlert
An android application built using Google maps API and Rest API to alert people where an emergency has happened



Citizen Alert is an online android based emergency reporting application that allows users to
report an emergency such as fire, health emergency and crime online. Unfortunately, due to
lack of technical expertise, lack of experience, incompetence of rescue agencies and low level
corruption, such emergencies are not properly reported and sometimes are left completely
untold. Essentially, the purpose of the project is to help members of society report incidents as
well as be aware of what is happening in their surroundings. By using the application, people
can know what areas to avoid, or where they can help. Rescue services, police and fire
departments can be informed about incidents immediately along with the exact location
ensuring quick and efficient response.

The locations pin-pointed on the map would be shown as custom markers having different
colors to uniquely identify the type of activity being carried out. Green markers for health
emergencies, red markers for fire emergencies and blue markers for crime related activities.
